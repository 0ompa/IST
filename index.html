<p>
    I love the Summer! Here are some reasons as to why I love Summer so much:

    <ul>
        <li>Summer Break!: School is out, and I can finally relax!</li>
        <li>Memorial Day: A day to honor Veterans who served our country</li>
        <li>Juneteenth: Day to commemorate the emancipation of enslaved African Americans</li>
        <li>Independence Day: July 4th- the USA gets independence from Great Britain</li>
        <li>Father's Day: Day to honor our fathers</li>
    </ul>

    Since I don't have to go to school, I can spend time with my family, friends, and doing other things that I love, like playing sports like tennis or basketball or playing chess, coding, or learning new things!

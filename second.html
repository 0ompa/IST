    Summer is when I leave all the stress I have and enjoy my time off.
    Look at the picture above. Now imagine yourself sitting there, feet in the sand,
    sun staring you down, and the ocean breeze cools you down. This is Summer.
    When school is out, and summer begins, I finally get a chance to breathe from my hectic
    school schedule. I can spend quality family time, going on vacations that'll make
    memories forever. Places to sight-see like New York City, or places to relax
    like Panama City Beach, Florida, are great and fun ways to make memories like this
    during the Summer. The great weather helps me get outdoors, hanging out with friends,
    playing tennis and basketball, and more. I can spend more time studying chess with the
    time I gained after Summer Break started. I'm able to join chess and tennis tournaments,
    and commit to my development in both sports. On top of this, I am able to study effectively
    for the upcoming school years to make sure that I am prepared for the materials that we
    will cover. I can also work towards other activities that I like to do, such as rebuilding
    for the upcoming Robotics season, preparing and learning FBLA competitive event topics, and
    honing my coding skills to prepare for upcoming hackathons that I want to compete in. Overall,
    I love my Summer, because I am able to relax from the stress that school provides, build upon
    my passions, and spend quality time with friends and family.
